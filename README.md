Full plots for GOR relationship with time is available in code with explanations on markdown.

In EUR calculations I used the Arps Decline with a hyperbolic decline.

The fits were good for most wells, to handle the erratic production profiles sometimes encountered a moving average was used which 'smoothened out' the data and lead to better fit

The limiting rate was set at 500bbl/month (although not necessarily realistic). I used this because some wells were already producing at <1000bbl/month. So I decided to used a lower limiting rate. As highlighted in my code markdowns Enerplus Energy had a lot of wells with high EUR values in 2015 (800,000 - 1M bbls) while Liberty resource had the well with the lowest EUR. Their decline curve is available in the codes and explanation in markdown.

I recognized Marathon Oil as the operator to have the most productive wells going forward based on the increase in their average first 6 month cumulative production from their new wells per year. Some notable mentions are Kraken Operating company, WPX and Enerplus.
